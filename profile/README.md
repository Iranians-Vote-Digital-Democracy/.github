# Iranians.Vote Cyberdemocracy Platform


## Introduction
Iranians.vote is a cyberdemocracy platform that assists you, the Iranian Digital Citizen, together with tens of millions of other Iranians to overcome islamic state, and is your first-go-to toolbox throughout the reconstruction. Imagine it as your buruea, digital foreign affiars ministry, your decentralised movement bank, and the interface with your digital parliament in exile.


The platform is designed for Iranians, by Iranians. Be it for grasroot or at country levet, Iranians.vote is there fore you.
You will have Forum, Voting Tools, Decentralised Banks (dBank), and a Marketplace where needs meet service providers.

You can build a state, United States of Iran.

## How it works
### Zero Knowledge Proofs for Digital Identity Cards
Zero-knowledge means you can prove you are Iranian without revealing any details about yourself. 

This is accessible to you using any of the following ID cards, the main key stays completely secure with you and your personal data will never leave your phone.
A hash of your data is used to prove your uniqueness. This is achieved using hash functions. A hash function protects privacy by converting sensitive data (like passwords or personal information) into a string of random-looking characters called a hash value. This way the original data cannot easily be revealed or read, even if someone gains access to the stored hash or has a supercomputer.

The identity cards that help you enter the platform are: 
- National ID Card کارت هوشمند ملی

- Biometric Passports. [ZK Passport](https://github.com/rarimo/#zk-passport)

## An interorganisation Body Needed
No signle organisation is capable of handling moderation of such a tool, and it needs all of them to be involved, and way beyond that, millions of Iranians and millions of Bitcoin (this one is bad for environment).


## How far are we
Technology is no longer a challenge, it is now more cultural. Iranians need to adapt to the idea of being in charge of building their own state. And we are not hopeless:  There are [100s](https://github.com/Atlasiran/Atlas-website/issues/29#issuecomment-2557870664) of Iranian organisations, parties and collectives and the numbers grows by day, everywhere in the world.

## Capabilities you need
If you don't have team, you can build one right away, or join a number of groups. If you want to build a party, no worries, platform helps you create one. From drafting code of conduct to drafting and signing all sorts of agreements, to writing motioins, to crowdfound the budgets needed and legislate how it should be spent. From organisation, building defence, to mobilisation, you will have all sorts of monetary, tech, security and communication tools needed.
